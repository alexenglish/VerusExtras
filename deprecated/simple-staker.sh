#This script comes with no warranty whatsoever. Use at your own risk.
#Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04
#Make sure you have a correct path set for the verus cli and that you've adjusted the variables below to suit your needs.

#This script will act on all unshielded coinbases and on all z_address balances

#Dependencies: bc (calculator)

#You can execute it manually whenever you want,
#or add the full path of the script to your VRSC.conf file
#using the parameter blocknotify=<path>
#The script needs to be run multiple times to carry funds forward through the two steps to go from block reward to staking. Recommended options are to run on a cron job every 3 to 5 minutes, or to run when new blocks are added using the blocknotify parameter to verusd as mentioned above.
#The blocknotify method is not recommended if you are not yet synced to the chain - make sure you're in sync, or close to it before setting this up with blocknotify

source config

#Desired target size for stakes
#smaller amounts will stake in full each time
#amounts larger than TARGET_STAKE will be staked at values ranging between TARGET_STAKE and TARGET_STAKE*2
TARGET_STAKE=250
TX_FEE=0.0001

#Only run every X blocks, useful if being run via blocknotify
#Recommended values are 3 to 10, set to zero to run every time this script is called regardless of the block number, which is useful if you're running it manually or on a cron job
#Keep in mind that the private transactions used for shielding are both memory and computation intensive, for machines doing PoW mining this should be set high so it doesn't spend as much time crunching the shielding transactions relative to the time spent on PoW.
